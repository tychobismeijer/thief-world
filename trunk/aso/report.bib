Abstract = {{This paper presents the architecture developed in the framework of the
   AWARE project for the autonomous distributed cooperation between
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), wireless sensor/actuator networks, and
   ground camera networks. One of the main goals was the demonstration of
   useful actuation capabilities involving multiple ground and aerial
   robots in the context of civil applications. A novel characteristic is
   the demonstration in field experiments of the transportation and
   deployment of the same load with single/multiple autonomous aerial
   vehicles. The architecture is endowed with different modules that solve
   the usual problems that arise during the execution of multipurpose
   missions, such as task allocation, conflict resolution, task
   decomposition, and sensor data fusion. The approach had to satisfy two
   main requirements: robustness for operation in disaster management
   scenarios and easy integration of different autonomous vehicles. The
   former specification led to a distributed design, and the latter was
   tackled by imposing several requirements on the execution capabilities
   of the vehicles to be integrated in the platform. The full approach was
   validated in field experiments with different autonomous helicopters
   equipped with heterogeneous devices onboard, such as visual/infrared
   cameras and instruments to transport loads and to deploy sensors. Four
   different missions are presented in this paper: sensor deployment and
   fire confirmation with UAVs, surveillance with multiple UAVs, tracking
   of firemen with ground and aerial sensors/cameras, and load
   transportation with multiple UAVs. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},
