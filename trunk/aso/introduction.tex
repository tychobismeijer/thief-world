Our goal within the current project is to show the applicability of the cellular automata model in transporting goods within a two dimensional environment. In this sense we are trying to design a cellular automata that can perform this task. We would like to limit our goal to the design of this system, that could be further extended afterwards. The physical realism of the model will not be considered within the project, since our goal is to show that a self-organizing system can achieve such behavior.

Research question: How to transport objects over gaps in a cellular automata model of self-configurable robots?

\subsection{Hypotheses}
Our hypotheses are the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The number of extra robots needed to push over a gap is independent of the gap size
 \item The number of reconfigurations is linearly dependent on the gap size.
 \item There is a linear correlation between the weight of the object that is transported and the minimum number of bots.
\end{itemize}
