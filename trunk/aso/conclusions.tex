The previous sections have shown how a cellular automata model could be used in the task of transporting a certain object within a gravity-affected world. 

The current study focuses primarily on solving the somewhat simple task of transporting a single box over a single gap of height 1. However, the rules used in our model could be used in far more complex situations within various world configurations. For example, the current model can be used to transport a convoy of boxes aligned one after another, where multiple bots combine their pushing power to move the heavier load. Another interesting extension to the model would be to determine its use in placing certain objects at specific locations within the world so that a certain sequence of tasks is met.
