Our goal within this paper is to show the applicability of the cellular automata model in transporting goods within a two dimensional environment. In this sense we have designed a cellular automata that can perform this task. The physical realism of the model was not be considered for the current model, since our goal is to show that a self-organizing system can achieve such behavior. In a nutshell we would like to describe how a cellular automata model can be used to transport objects over gaps within a world in which gravity affects the movements of objects. Our study considers variations of variables such as gap size, object weight and number of cellular automata bots initially placed within the system, which have a direct effect on how fast the object is transported to the final location.
