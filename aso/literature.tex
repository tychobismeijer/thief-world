As mentioned previously, the literature related to cellular automata has been rapidly growing in the past decades. However, the limited interest in practical applications had given the domain a rather exclusive touch until only recently. 

Our work is inspired by the cellular automata model by Butler et al.\cite{butler02}.
The idea of using a cellular automata to control self configurable robots
come from Butler et al., they move bots around a flat surface. This model is
then also implemented in different real robots. We extend upon this by
considering pushing around objects, and gravity causing bots to fall down.
