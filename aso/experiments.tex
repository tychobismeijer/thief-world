The experiments we will be presenting in the following sections take into account each of the hypotheses we previously mentioned. For this we have chosen four fundamental variables to study: the gap size, the number of bots used, the weight of a single box and the number of reconfigurations required to solve a specific setting. Out of these, the first three were considered to be independent variables, while the latter was the dependent variable. 

We are primarily focusing on determining the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item whether the number of extra robots needed to push over a gap is independent of the gap size;
 \item whether the number of reconfigurations is linearly dependent on the gap size;
 \item is there a linear correlation between the weight of the object that is transported and the minimum number of bots?
\end{enumerate}

The following experiments were performed in the same world, with the characteristics presented in table \ref{tbl:world}. We can see that here the box is placed each time before the gap and the bots are placed behind it at random positions (on both the $x$ and $y$ axis).
